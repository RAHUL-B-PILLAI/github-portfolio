								<h3>About the Project</h3>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/prisum1.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

								<p>While at Iowa State, I immersed myself in and eventually led PrISUm as its Mechanical Director. Much like Northwestern’s NUsolar, PrISUm is a student-run club which designs, builds, and races solar-powered electric vehicles, and I was at the helm of all mechanical system design as a sophomore. During my tenure as Mechanical Director, I repeatedly found myself stretched beyond my abilities, often requiring that I teach myself higher-level course material prior to taking the relevant class. The additional effort only accelerated my mastery of the subjects and solidified my propensity for self-directed learning.</p>

								<p>The most engrossing project I undertook, however, is absent from my transcript. For nearly three years, I dedicated much of my time to immerse myself in and eventually lead PrISUm as its Mechanical Director. Much like Northwestern’s NUsolar, PrISUm is a student-run club which designs, builds, and races solar-powered electric vehicles, and I was at the helm of all mechanical system design as a sophomore. During my tenure as Mechanical Director, I repeatedly found myself stretched beyond my abilities, often requiring that I teach myself higher-level course material prior to taking the relevant class. The additional effort only accelerated my mastery of the subjects and solidified my propensity for self-directed learning.</p>

								<h3>Learn More</h3>
								<p>Although I no longer actively work on the project, current and future teams are still working hard to push the boundaries of what is possible with solar-powered transportation. I urge you to get involved, donate to the team, or even just spread the word in order to assist these bright students as they progress this outstanding technology.</p>
